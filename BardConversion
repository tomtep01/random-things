I have multiple .php files, and there's a text that's hard-coded that is somewhere. How do I find the location of it? I use Windows and XAMPP

Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the steps on how to find the location of a hard-coded text in .php files in Windows using XAMPP:

Open a command prompt window.
Navigate to the directory where your .php files are located.
Type the following command:
findstr /i "hard-coded text" *.php
Replace hard-coded text with the text you are looking for.

The command will output the location of all the .php files that contain the hard-coded text.
For example, if you are looking for the hard-coded text "This is a hard-coded text", the command output will look like this:

C:\xampp\htdocs\my-project\index.php
C:\xampp\htdocs\my-project\another-file.php
Once you have the location of the hard-coded text, you can then open the file and modify it as needed.

Here are some additional tips:

You can use the findstr command to search for other types of text, such as numbers or keywords.
You can use the /n option to output the line number of each match.
You can use the /r option to recursively search all subdirectories.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Findstr can't seem to find .php files in multiple directories, can you make it check for all directories?

Sure, you can use the /s option with the findstr command to recursively search all subdirectories. For example, the following command will search for the hard-coded text "This is a hard-coded text" in all .php files in the current directory and its subdirectories:

findstr /i "This is a hard-coded text" /s *.php
The output of the command will be a list of all the .php files that contain the hard-coded text, regardless of where they are located in the directory structure.

Here is an example of the command output:

C:\xampp\htdocs\my-project\index.php
C:\xampp\htdocs\my-project\another-file.php
C:\xampp\htdocs\my-project\subfolder\one.php
C:\xampp\htdocs\my-project\subfolder\two.php
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
