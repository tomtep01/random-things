Every year in Cao Bang, there's a festival called Ky Sam Festival that starts on the 10th day of the first lunar month at Ky Sam Temple, a temple which was built for a historical figure named Nung Tri Cao, who helped protect Vietnam back in the Ly Dynasty. After he died, Ky Sam Temple was built from the Ly Dynasty.
At exactly eleven-thirty PM, the festival starts off with traditional rituals. Elderly people start to offer tea and wish for the country and people with good weather, good harvests, and hope that all people will have good health in the new year.
In this festival, people visit the temple to thank Nung Tri Cao. But there are also fun traditional games like tug-of-war, blindfolded pottery smashing, weightlifting, stilts walking, and more. Within the festival, there is also an exhibition of newspapers and books.
On the night of the festival, thousands of people go to the temple to pray for a lucky new year. This is a festival that attracts a large amount of tourists.
You might even see lion dances. It's a chance to learn about the history of Vietnam, play some fun traditional games, and have fun.
Thanks for listening to our presentation!</pre>
